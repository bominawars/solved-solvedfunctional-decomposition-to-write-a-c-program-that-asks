Homework 2Use functional decomposition to write a C++ program that asks the user to enter his or her weight and the name of a planet. The program then outputs how much the user would weigh on that planet. The following table gives the factor by which the weight must be multiplied for each planet. The program should output an error message if the user doesnâ€™t type a correct planet name. The prompt and the error message should make it clear to the user how a planet name must be entered. Be sure to use proper formatting and appropriate comments in your code. The output should be labeled clearly and formatted neatly.Mercury 0.4155Venus 0.8975Earth 1.0Moon 0.166Mars 0.3507Jupiter 2.5374Saturn 1.0677Uranus 0.8947Neptune 1.1794Pluto 0.0899
